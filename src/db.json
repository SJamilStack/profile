It was an inception of his career when we work in a project, and his way of thinking, analysis a problem, planning and quality of work really amazed me. At the end, his hard work paid off by making the project successful. He has all the required attributes that is quite a rear combination to find in a developer all together. And I would say this professional characteristic makes him a valuable asset to any organization. It would be a great pleasure for me if I ever get a chance to work with him again in future. I would highly recommend him for his outstanding technical skills and professionalism.",
